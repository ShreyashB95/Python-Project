Data Preprocessing
Data Import: The dataset was loaded using Pandas from a CSV file.

Cleaning and Formatting:
Irrelevant columns like 'Status' and 'unnamed1' were dropped.
Null values were removed from the dataset.
Data types were adjusted, for instance, converting the 'Amount' column to integer type.
